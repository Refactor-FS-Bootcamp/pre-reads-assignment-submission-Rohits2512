    <p>Roses are erect, climbing, or trailing shrubs, the stems of which are usually
     copiously armed with prickles of various shapes and sizes, commonly called thorns. 
     The leaves are alternate and pinnately compound (i.e., feather-formed), usually with 
     oval leaflets that are sharply toothed.</p>
     <p>In cultures across the world, red roses are seen as a symbol of love and passion. There are a number of other species that also 
        include red roses, from delicate anemone to the robust spray carnation. A flower for seduction, romance and danger, red is a 
        powerful and bold colour statement.</p>
